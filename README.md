# AI-Chatbot


This is a Django-based chat application that uses PostgreSQL as its database. This README provides the steps to set up PostgreSQL for the project and manage dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or later
- PostgreSQL 12 or later
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Step 1: Install PostgreSQL

## Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL
1. Access PostgreSQL
Open the PostgreSQL command-line interface (psql):

psql -U postgres
You might need to enter the password you set during installation.

2. Create a New Database
Create a database for your Django project:

CREATE DATABASE chat_db;

3. Create a Database User
Create a new user (role) for your project:

CREATE USER chat_user WITH PASSWORD 'chatdb';

4. Grant Privileges
Grant the necessary privileges to the new user for the newly created database:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE chat_db TO chat_user;

5. Exit psql
Exit the PostgreSQL prompt by typing:

\q

## Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your projectâ€™s dependencies.

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install Dependencies from requirements.txt
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file into your virtual environment.


## Step 4: Run Migrations
Apply the database migrations to set up your database schema:

python manage.py migrate

Step 6: Create a Superuser
Create a superuser account to access the Django admin interface:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create your admin user.

Step 7: Run the Django Development Server
Start the Django development server to test the setup:

python manage.py runserver
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/aichat/home in your browser. Log in to the admin interface using the superuser credentials at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
